**OTC or ZERO-ROYALTY TRADE IS FORBIDDEN!**
{% endhint %}

Our low renewal price regime also depends on royalties. If you want to be a holder, you should prefer trading by royalty. Thus, the ThorNode board decided to BAN OTC trading. If you do OTC trade, you have to send related royalty share to thornode.sol address. Otherwise your NFT will be burned and reissued.\
\
If you do not pay the royalty during trade, you need to pay enforced royalty fee as given below:\
**For Classic Pass:**\
Floor price is below 5 SOL- Fee is 0.5 SOL\
Floor price is above 5 SOL- Fee is floor/10 in SOL\
\
**For Elite Pass:**\
Floor price is below 10 SOL - Fee is 1 SOL\
Floor price is above 10 SOL- Fee is floor/10 in SOL

**For Prime Pass:**\
Floor price is below 70 SOL - Fee is 7 SOL\
Floor price is above 70 SOL- Fee is floor/10 in SOL
