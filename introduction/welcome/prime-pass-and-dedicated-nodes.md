## Who is Prime Pass For?

ThorNode Prime is perfect for:

* **Individuals** who want full control and fastest possible over their RPC infrastructure
* **DAOs** requiring reliable, dedicated access
* **Projects** needing high-performance Solana RPC for production use

## Two-Part Access System

Prime Pass provides two types of RPC access:

### Shared Location Access (4 Locations)

You select **4 locations** from all available ThorLabs shared locations (same pool as Classic/Elite/Flash passes):

* **1 IP per location** - authenticate one IP address at each of your 4 chosen locations
* **Unique advantage** - You can select the same location multiple times (e.g., 4x Virginia = 4 different IPs on the same endpoint)
* Other pass types cannot authenticate multiple IPs to the same endpoint like this

Example configurations:

* 4 different locations (Virginia, Frankfurt, Tokyo, London)
* 2x Virginia + 2x Frankfurt
* 4x Virginia (4 different IPs on one endpoint)

### Dedicated Standalone RPC

In addition to shared locations, you receive your own **dedicated RPC**:

* Built specifically for you within 2-3 business days
* **Unlimited IP authentications** - add as many IPs as you need
* Not shared with any other users
* Full control over your dedicated infrastructure
* Perfect for teams and scaling
